      title: 'History of IEEE',
      body: 'IEEE’s roots go back to <b>1884</b> when electricity began to become a major influence in society. There was one major established electrical industry, the telegraph, which since the 1840s had come to connect the world with a data communications system faster than the speed of transportation. The telephone and electric power and light industries had just gotten underway.',

    p1: 'The Computer Society was established at An-Najah National University in 2014.The Society aims to develop the student’s communication & programming skills, recognize them in the labor market, improve their skills and potentials and help them to cooperate with other IEEE members around the world. Moreover, the society hosts International competitions liks: IEEE Xtreme and IEEE madC. We should note that our branch took first place in IEEE Xtreme competition in Palestine last year.',
    p2: 'The society also organizes a lot of activities such as contests, online sessions and practical sessions, for example Think like a Programmer Competition (TLAP). It aims to develop logical thinking and solve problems. It is a competition not specific to the computer students, which means that any student can participate and develop his skills. Also XCoders is a programming contest to solve programming problems and issues using programming languages. And Web Contest, it is the best website contest to encourage and support outstanding students, and shade the light on successful projects that the students developed it on their courses.In addition, C/C++ and python practical sessions to improve students skills in these programming languages in a nice practical way.',
    p3: 'Moreover, the Computer Society makes visits and tours to software companies in order to familiarize students with the nature of work in these companies.',
